                 I am a friendly technology professional with working knowledge of Python, shell scripting, HTML, SCSS and the Django framework.
                <br /><br />
                I like to make illustrations and sculptures, play music, and hang out with my dog, Blott The Dog.
                <br /><br />
                I have a demonstrated working history with Linux and Windows servers, 
                virtual server deployment and management, virtual systems architecture, and cloud-based projects leveraging Amazon Web Services.
                <br /><br />
                This site you are on is built exclusively with an AWS serverless architecture, 
                leveraging Route 53, Security Manager, S3 Buckets, CloudFront CDN, and a Codepipline connected to GitHub.

                I think simple things like HTML, CSS, and Python are all you need to change the world
